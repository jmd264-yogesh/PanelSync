## 1. What Is This?

**PanelSync** is an internal interview scheduling tool for a Microsoft-org team. It helps engineering managers:
- Track interview pipelines (candidates, roles, panel members)
- Collect panel availability via tokenised links
- Book Teams meetings on confirmed slots
- Manage a pre-approved panelist directory (L1 / L2 roles)
- Send Teams chat messages requesting panelist availability slots

**Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Drizzle ORM · Neon Postgres · Microsoft Graph API

## 3. Authentication

- **Provider**: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) OAuth2  
- **Flow**: Redirect to `/api/auth/callback` → JWT session stored in `sessions.json` (local) + cookie  
- **Session helper**: `src/lib/session.ts` — `getSession(req)` returns `{ accessToken, userId, userDisplayName, userEmail }`
- **Access token** is passed down from server components to Graph API calls; token refresh is handled in `session.ts`

---

## 4. Database (Neon Postgres + Drizzle ORM)

Connection string env var: `DATABASE_URL`

### Tables (defined in `src/lib/schema.ts`)

| Table | Key Fields |
|---|---|
| `sessions` | `id`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `user_id`, `user_display_name`, `user_email` |
| `interviews` | `id`, `candidate_name`, `candidate_email`, `role`, `duration` (mins), `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, `teams_meeting_url`, `calendar_event_id`, `scheduled_slot_start`, `scheduled_slot_end` |
| `interview_panels` | `id`, `interview_id` (FK→interviews cascade), `user_id` (Graph ID), `name`, `email`, `token` (unique URL token), `status` (PENDING/SUBMITTED), `submitted_at` |
| `panel_availabilities` | `id`, `panel_id` (FK→interview_panels cascade), `start_time`, `end_time` |
| `panelists` | `id` (Graph user ID), `display_name`, `email`, `roles` (text[] e.g. ['L1','L2']), `created_at` |
| `uploaded_candidates` | `id`, `name`, `email`, `status` (WAITING/MAPPED), `mapped_interview_id` (FK→interviews cascade), `college`, `created_at` |
| `colleges` | `id`, `name` (unique), `created_at` |
| `drives` | `id`, `college_name`, `start_date`, `end_date` (drive window range), `status` (OPEN/CLOSED), `is_active` (boolean), `created_at` |

### Interview Status Flow
```
PENDING  →  COLLECTED  →  SCHEDULED
                ↑               ↓
         (cancel booking)  CANCELLED
```
- `PENDING` — waiting for all panels to submit availability
- `COLLECTED` — all panels submitted; ready to book
- `SCHEDULED` — Teams meeting booked
- `CANCELLED` — manually cancelled

### DB Helper (`src/lib/db.ts` → `export const db`)
All methods are async. Key ones:
- `db.getInterviews()` — all interviews with nested panels + availabilities
- `db.getInterview(id)` — single interview
- `db.getInterviewByPanelToken(token)` — look up by panel URL token
- `db.createInterview(params)` — creates interview + panel rows
- `db.submitAvailability(token, slots)` — saves slots, auto-transitions to COLLECTED
- `db.bookInterview(id, params)` — sets scheduled slot + Teams meeting
- `db.cancelBooking(id)` — reverts booking, recalculates status
- `db.deleteInterview(id)`
- `db.getPanelists()` — panelist directory
- `db.addPanelist(user, roles)` — upsert
- `db.removePanelist(id)`
- `db.getUploadedCandidates()` — get all candidates in queue
- `db.addUploadedCandidates(candidates)` — bulk insert candidates
- `db.deleteUploadedCandidate(id)` — delete candidate from queue
- `db.autoMapPendingCandidates(tokenInfo)` — map waiting candidates to ready L1 panels
- `db.getColleges()` — get all registered colleges
- `db.addCollege(name)` — register a new college with a generated UUID
- `db.deleteCollege(id)` — remove college by ID
- `db.getDrives()` — get all scheduled drives
- `db.getActiveDrive()` — get the single active drive or null
- `db.createDrive(collegeName, startDate, endDate)` — schedule a new drive spanning a date range
- `db.setActiveDrive(id)` — set the active drive (toggling all others inactive); only an OPEN drive can be made active
- `db.setDriveStatus(id, 'OPEN' | 'CLOSED')` — open/close a drive; closing also clears its active flag
- `db.deleteDrive(id)` — delete a drive record

---

## 5. Microsoft Graph Integration (`src/lib/graph.ts`)

`GraphService` class (singleton export: `graphService`).  
All methods accept `accessToken: string` from the current session.

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `searchUsers(query, token)` | Search org users by name/email |
| `createTeamsMeeting(...)` | Creates an online Teams meeting via `/me/onlineMeetings` |
| `createCalendarEvent(...)` | Creates a calendar event on the user's calendar |
| `deleteCalendarEvent(id, token)` | Deletes a calendar event |
| `sendTeamsMessage(targetUserId, htmlContent, token)` | Creates a 1:1 Teams chat and sends an HTML message |
| `getTeamsChat(targetUserId, token)` | Gets or creates a 1:1 chat |

---

## 6. Main Dashboard Architecture

`DashboardClient.tsx` is now a **thin orchestrator** (~110 lines) that owns only cross-tab shared state and renders the appropriate tab component.

### Shared State in DashboardClient
```ts
activeTab: 'interviews' | 'panelists' | 'recruiters' | 'candidates' | 'colleges' | 'drives'
interviews: Interview[]           // shared between Interviews and Panelists tabs
panelists: Panelist[]             // shared between Interviews and Panelists tabs
collegesList: College[]           // shared between Interviews, Panelists, Candidates, Colleges, and Drives tabs
candidates: UploadedCandidate[]   // shared between Interviews and Candidates tabs
drives: Drive[]                   // shared drives list
activeDrive: Drive | null         // single active drive pre-filled across tabs
todayStr: string                  // ISO date string for today, passed to children
```

### Tab Components (`src/app/dashboard/components/`)

#### `InterviewsTab.tsx` — self-manages UI state
```ts
// UI States (local)
statusFilter, cockpitView, selectedInterview, showCreateForm, detailTab
candidateName, candidateEmail, role, duration, startDate, endDate
interviewType: 'L1' | 'L2' | 'General'
selectedPanels: GraphUser[]
selectedSlot, bookingDescription
isEditingDates, editStartDate, editEndDate
selectedDriveId: string  // which drive the dashboard scopes to (in-tab selector)
drives: Drive[] (passed prop)  // populates the "Viewing Drive" selector
activeDrive: Drive | null (passed prop) // only used to seed the initial selected drive
// Handlers: handleCreateInterview, handleDeleteInterview, handleBookSlot,
//           handleCancelBooking, handleResendInvite, handleUpdateDates
```
The dashboard scopes all metrics and lists to the **selected drive** (a "Viewing Drive" dropdown at the top), not the global active drive. It seeds to the active drive on first load, then the recruiter can switch to any drive (including closed ones) without changing the global active drive. Selecting a drive filters interviews to that drive's college **and** date window (start → end); "All Drives" shows everything.

#### `PanelistsTab.tsx` — self-manages UI state
```ts
// Key state (local)
reqPanelists: Panelist[]         // panelists selected for slot request
reqDuration, reqStartDate, reqEndDate, reqInterviewType
reqSlots: { startTime, endTime, selected }[]
bulkSelectedL1Ids: string[]      // IDs selected in L1 column only
bulkSelectedL2Ids: string[]      // IDs selected in L2 column only
l1TimeStart, l1TimeEnd           // default '10:00' – '13:00'
l2TimeStart, l2TimeEnd           // default '14:00' – '17:00'
defaultStartDate, defaultEndDate
collegeName: string
activeDrive: Drive | null (passed prop, updates default timing configs)
```

#### `CandidatesTab.tsx` — self-manages UI state  
Handles bulk upload (xlsx), single candidate add, inline editing, and mapping candidates to interviews.
- **Scoping & Filters**: Integrates `activeDrive` to default filter scoping to the active drive on load (matching candidate's college or drive college). Allows filtering by status, college (drive), and drive date.
- **Split L1/L2 Results**: Displays candidate outcomes under separate **L1 Result** and **L2 Result** columns, calculated dynamically from actual interview panel decisions and `outcomeStatus` values.
- **Excel Export**: Features an **Export to Excel** button to download the filtered candidate list as a formatted `.xlsx` spreadsheet with auto-fitted columns.

#### `RecruitersTab.tsx` — fully self-contained (no props)  
Manages the recruiter access list, add/delete recruiters.

#### `CollegesTab.tsx` — accepts `collegesList` + `setCollegesList` props  
Manages college directory; owns its own `fetchColleges` internally.

#### `DrivesTab.tsx` — accepts drives and activeDrive props  
Manages drive schedule, creates new drives spanning a **start/end date range**, switches the active drive (synchronized across all tabs), **closes/reopens drives** (a closed drive can't be active; reopen restores it), and deletes drives. Each drive shows its date window and an OPEN/CLOSED/Active status badge.

### Interviews Tab
- List view + tracker/cockpit view toggle
- Drive Metrics Dashboard at the top:
  - **Candidates Mapped Card**: Displays the mapped / total candidates ratio, pending candidates count, and a sleek progress bar indicating mapping progress.
  - **Panel Requests Card (Interactive)**: Combines total requests sent, accepted requests, rejected requests, and requests yet to respond. Clicking this card opens a detailed status dialog listing panel members prioritized by status:
    1. **Yet to Respond** (status `PENDING`)
    2. **Rejected** (status `REJECTED`, showing rejection reason)
    3. **Accepted** (status `SUBMITTED`)
  - **Interview Results Card (Interactive)**: Displays total passed and rejected counts for the cohort. Clicking this card opens a detailed feedback dialog showing panelist names, ratings, and feedback text for each candidate.
- Cards show: status badge, candidate, role, duration, date range, panel list with their submission status
- Status badges: `PENDING` (orange), `COLLECTED` (blue), `SCHEDULED` (green), `CANCELLED` (red)
- Click a card → side panel with slot overlap matrix, book button, Teams link
- Booking flow: picks an overlapping slot → calls `/api/interviews/book` → creates Teams meeting + calendar event

### Panelists Tab
- Panelist directory split into two columns: **L1 Screening Panels** and **L2 System/Mgmt Panels**
- Each column has its own "Select All" checkbox
- Per-panelist checkboxes use SEPARATE state arrays (`bulkSelectedL1Ids` / `bulkSelectedL2Ids`) so the same person appearing in both L1 and L2 lists has independent checked state
- Sticky floating action bar when any selection → "Request L1 Slots" / "Request L2 Slots" buttons
- Slot request modal: date range picker, time windows, generates per-day slots, sends Teams message via `/api/interviews/request-panelist`
- Admin add: search org users → assign L1/L2 roles → save
- **Interview Scheduler Defaults** card (renamed from "Auto-Scheduler Timing Configurations"): 4-column configuration panel with:
  - L1 Timing Period (start/end time for L1 scheduling window)
  - L2 Timing Period (start/end time for L2 scheduling window)
  - Default Proposed Date Range (start/end date pre-filled in slot request modals)
  - College / Institution dropdown — default college selected from the central colleges directory

### Colleges Tab
- Central directory to view, register, and delete colleges we will be going for interviews.
- Single source of truth: adding colleges here populates dropdowns across scheduler settings, slot request modals, and candidate bulk uploads.

## 7. Panelist Slot Request Flow (New Flow)

> This is the "Panelist-first" scheduling flow — collect slots before assigning a candidate.

1. Manager selects panelists from the directory (bulk or individual)
2. Opens slot request modal: sets duration and interview type. The **date window and college are taken automatically from the Active Drive** (shown read-only in the modal) — the recruiter is not asked for start/end dates. If no active drive is set, the modal falls back to a manual college dropdown + date-range inputs and warns the user to set an active drive.
3. App generates proposed time slots across the active drive's date window (respecting L1/L2 time windows)
4. Manager selects which slots to include
5. Clicks send → `POST /api/interviews/request-panelist`
6. API creates an interview record with `candidateName = 'Pending Assignment'` and appends the college name to the role (e.g. `L1 Interview - IIT Bombay`)
7. Inserts a panel row for each panelist, generates unique token
8. Sends a Teams 1:1 message (HTML card) with availability link, showing the college name in the request card description

Later, candidate is attached via `POST /api/interviews/assign-candidate`.

---

## 8. Candidate Bulk Upload and Automated Mapping Flow (New Flow)

> This flow handles bulk uploads of candidates and their automatic pairing to L1 interview slots.

1. Recruiter selects a college under "College Name of Drive (Optional)" from the dropdown and/or specifies a drive date under "Drive Date (Optional)" and uploads an Excel (.xlsx, .xls) or CSV template in the **Candidate Queue** dashboard tab.
2. The candidates are parsed, pulling from the spreadsheet columns such as "Name", "Email", "College Name of Drive" (or "College", "Institution", "University", "College Name"), and "Drive Date" (or "Date", "Preferred Date", "Interview Date", "Date of Drive") with fallback to the default selections in the upload card. The parsed records are saved into the `uploaded_candidates` table with status `WAITING`.
3. The system immediately checks for any "ready" L1 interviews (which have `candidateName = 'Pending Assignment'`, status is `COLLECTED`, and have a confirmed/booked slot).
4. If found, it automatically maps the oldest waiting candidates to these L1 interviews:
   - Updates the interview's candidate details.
   - Sets the interview status to `SCHEDULED`.
   - Patches the Microsoft Teams calendar event with candidate name and email.
   - Marks the candidate as `MAPPED` in the database.
5. If no ready panels are available, candidates wait in the queue (`WAITING`).
6. Once a panelist accepts/books a slot for a pending assignment L1 interview (calling `/api/availability/select-slot`), the system checks for waiting candidates and automatically maps the oldest waiting candidate to that interview immediately.

---

## 9. Availability Submission (`src/app/availability/[token]`)

- Public page, no auth required
- Token in URL → `db.getInterviewByPanelToken(token)` → shows interview details
- Panelist picks their available time slots from a calendar-style picker
- Submits → `db.submitAvailability(token, slots)`
- When all panels submit, interview auto-transitions to `COLLECTED`

---

## 10. Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=                    # Neon Postgres connection string
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=              # App registration client ID
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=          # App registration client secret
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=              # Azure AD tenant ID
NEXTAUTH_URL=                    # Public base URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000)
SESSION_SECRET=                  # JWT signing secret (for session cookies)
```

---

## 11. Key Conventions & Gotchas

- **Next.js 16 App Router** — all server components in `page.tsx`, client logic in `*Client.tsx` files
- **No Tailwind** — vanilla CSS only; design tokens live in `globals.css` as CSS custom properties (`--primary`, `--border-glass`, `--radius-md`, etc.)
- **Drizzle migrations** via `drizzle-kit` — run `npx drizzle-kit migrate` to apply schema changes
- **`sessions.json`** is a local file cache for session data (not for production use)
- **`db.json`** is a legacy/scratch file — not in active use
- **Graph token** is the logged-in user's delegated access token (not app-only); all Graph calls act as the current user
- **Panelist ID** = Microsoft Graph User ID (`string`)  
- **Interview Panel** (`interview_panels`) is the join between an interview and a panelist — distinct from the `panelists` directory table
- **Bulk selection collision fix**: `bulkSelectedL1Ids` and `bulkSelectedL2Ids` are fully separate arrays — never merge them; a panelist in both L1 and L2 columns must be toggled independently per column

---
